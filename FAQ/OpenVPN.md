0. Send me an email asking for the VPN certificate. I will send you an __.ovpn__ file which will be your certificate.
1. Download the installation file from the [webpage](https://openvpn.net/community/) or Alga drive at `\\192.168.1.2.\programs\ # TODO`
2. Run the __OpenVPN-x.x.x-I0001-amd64.msi__ installation file and leave everything as default. Make sure to agree to installing the windows TAP drivers.
